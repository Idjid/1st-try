        Extraction Corporation and the first Planet Cracker-class ship. The
        Ishimura was also the first vessel of its size to be outfitted with a
        ShockPoint Drive and utilize it for large-scale commercial and deep
        space expeditions. It was named after Hideki Ishimura, astrophysicist
        and the inventor of the ShockPoint Drive.

            Titan Station, colloquially known as the Sprawl, was an EarthGov
            space station built into the last remaining fragment of Titan, one
            of Saturn's moons and the site of the first planet crack in the
            2440s. Titan Station itself encircled the Shard of Titan as a large
            metropolis, with inner structures such as schools, malls,
            skyscrapers, and a Unitologist church. The population of the station
            exceeded one million people.

            Tau Volantis is a planet roughly three quarters the size of Earth
            located in the HR 8799 system, where, over two million years ago, an
            alien civilization sacrificed itself to stop a Convergence Event.
            Tau Volantis was incorrectly presumed to be the source of the
            Markers and the Necromorph life form by the Sovereign Colonies Armed
            Forces and, centuries later, by Ellie Langford's team.

            Unknown to Barrow, an Infector had boarded his shuttle and infected
            his wife's corpse. After Barrow was killed and his shuttle crashed,
            his wife, the Infector and presumably a newly infected Colin Barrow
            escaped into the Ishimura's ventilation system and made short work
            of the Flight Deck crew before security could respond. The Infector
            made its way to the Morgue where it changed at least twenty corpses
            into Necromorphs which made their way around the ship.
